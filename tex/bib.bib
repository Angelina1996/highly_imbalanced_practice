	abstract = {{pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with  ” relational” or  ” labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.}},
